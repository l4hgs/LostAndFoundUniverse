## 🪐 Overview  
Lost & Found Universe is an interactive journaling-inspired system designed to help users map out their memories and emotions from the past. It serves as a reflective space to help users travel through the memories they've made with people they’ve crossed paths with, the moments that shaped them, and the items or connections that may no longer be present in their lives. Through simple prompts, the program brings awareness to “lost memories” within their personal universe, making it easier to revisit moments that may have faded over time and bring clarity to what may otherwise remain unnoticed.
